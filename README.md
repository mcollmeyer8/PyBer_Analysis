# PyBer_Challenge_Analysis

## **Overview of the analysis**

Analyzation of 2019 ride-share data for Pyber

## **Results**

As would be expected, we found in our research that Urban areas had more total numbers of rides as well as more drivers. However, the numbers may surprise you.
Urban areas had 1625 total rides in 2019, and Rural areas had 125. That's 13 times as many for Urban vs Rural!
With so many more rides, it's no surprise that Urban areas had more drivers - 2405. But would you have expected us to say that they have over 30x as many as Rural areas? 
We tallied only 78 drivers in Rural areas. While they might be less busy, the Rural drivers were found to make approximately $10 more per ride than their Urban counterparts.

## **Summary**

Using Python, Pandas and Matplotlib, we analyzed ride share data for PyBer and created visualization in the forms of various graphs and charts.
Based on our findings, we would recommend the following to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

1. Certain Urban areas could use more drivers. The scatter chart found that 2 of the Urban cities with the highest # of rides has some of the smaller numbers of drivers.  
2. Urban cities provide for over 60% of total fares collected by the company in 2019. Rural areas accounted for only 6.8%. We should look into how much marketing is taking place in rural areas. Do they even know we are an option?
3. Only 2.9% of our drivers are in rural areas. We should also research growth opportunities in this category.
